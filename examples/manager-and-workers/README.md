Mostly default example
======================
This example shows the default of a 3-manager with 5-worker swarm.  In addition some customizations done for the provisioning are:

1. exposing two Elastic IPs (as there's a limit to Elastic IPs being provisioned)
2. exposing the SSH, HTTP and HTTPS ports
3. adding two custom users with their SSH keys
4. Outputting the IPs.
