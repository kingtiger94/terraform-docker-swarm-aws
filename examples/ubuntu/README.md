This is a proof of concept of using Ubuntu rather than Amazon Linux as the OS.  This will allow the latest version of Docker to be installed as the Amazon Linux image does not allow installing the latest version of Docker.

The purpose of this is not really to build as Swarm but to set up a development machine.

Because it is not Amazon Linux, it does not have simple access to cloudwatch agents so that won't be created
